![At dOrg we are creating &quot;digital organisms&quot;](../.gitbook/assets/dorgs2.gif)

**dOrg** - a self-service web3 development agency; structured as a reputation-weighted DAO with legal personality

**Reputation** - voting weight on proposals to the DAO; non-transferrable 

**DORG Token** - token issued by the DAO to track unpaid obligations

**Proposal** - basic unit of decision-making for any DAO action \(payments, adding/removing Rep, issuing Tokens, ratifying agreements, modifying the DAO, and more\)

{% hint style="info" %}
Anyone can **submit** a proposal to the DAO. Anyone with reputation in the DAO can **vote** to approve or reject a proposal. All votes are be **publicly visible** in the [Ethereum](web3.md#ethereum) Blockchain. If the proposal **passes**, anyone can **execute** the action specified.

Submitting, voting and executing proposals costs [Gas](web3.md#gas).
