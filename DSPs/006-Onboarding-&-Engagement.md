# Onboarding & Engagement Q1 2021

**Author(s)**: @steffbrowne

## Summary

This proposal establishes a new workstream focused on improving the quality of builder engagement across the DAO. Weâ€™ll guide this work stream by
- Facilitating effective & ongoing collaboration
- Coordinating work bins to achieve measurable outcomes
- Analyzing and reporting our progress to the DAO
- Unifying work bins into learning milestones, so that we can evolve & iterate

## Why should we fund this?

We need to continue to have dedicated people maintaining and improving our processes as we continue to take on on a higher volume of projects and builders.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

This workstream covers the quality of engagement with and within the DAO at any of these stages:
- Discovering the DAO
- Onboarding
- Project enrollment
- Ongoing empowerment
- Referrals

Sample work bins will likely include these and more...
- Mapping the [Member Journey](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1z47NnQ91T0OvlHFYXhwEY9SSEmz1Tj0MpNeT695XKJE/edit) (Steff)
- Improve systems for organizing contact lists and running comms (Steff)
- Keeping our Twitter active (Bernie)
- Advising on procedures that improve quality of work (Ori)
- Getting client feedback and measuring customer happiness (Rob)
- Builder outreach campaign (Rob)

This workstream will lead to new initiatives as well as build off of old / existing ones, such as,
