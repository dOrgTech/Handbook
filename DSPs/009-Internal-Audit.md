# Internal Audit 

**Author(s)**: @shresth31

## Summary
Create a knowledge base & checklist for dOrg's internal audits.

## Why should we fund this?

As dOrg is growing in number, with builders of varied levels of experties, and as the defi / smart-contract space is expanding with new and complex architectures, it's hard for all the builders to keep up with all new vulnerabilities in each project. 

## Anything else you'd like to add?

* The **Knowledge Base** will be structured like a blog. Every article would precisely describe a bug/ vulnerability with valid examples to repicate, ways to mitigate, and external resources to read more about it.
* The **Checklist** would be a form. This form based on the key features of the smart-contract would sugest the dev to justify security against certain vulnerabilities. You should be able to export a PDF of the answers and share it.
* **Deliverables**
    - Find a good name
    - Few high quality articles (especially focused on the recent Defi hacks) also reviewed by white hat hackers from the community.
    - Checklist form intergrated with knowledge base 
    - Proper release with a medium blog

* More details about the proposal could be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/129MsSonsqp0SHAkqsmeXdIurUf7GiA33WsvrGerTIGE/edit).

* Other Points to keep in mind:
    + Keep the structure minimalistic 
    + Collaborate with as many builders as possible. This will also support the adoption inside dOrg. 
    + Keep eveything private in the start, have a proper release and then Opensource it. Opensourcing gives huge credebility to dOrg and creates the possibility to fund the project through Gitcoin Grants in future.  
   
* Future aspects suggested:
    -  There is a possibility to create an auditing DAO 
    -  Create a bug bounty programm to add new articles (paid in X stable coins + Y dOrg tokens). This could also be used for onboarding new builders.
