# Internal Audit 

**Author(s)**: @shresth31

## Summary
Create a knowledge base & checklist for dOrg's internal audits.

## Why should we fund this?

As dOrg is growing in number, with builders of varied levels of experties, and as the defi / smart-contract space is expanding with new and complex architectures, it's hard for all the builders to keep up with all new vulnerabilities in each project. 

## Anything else you'd like to add?

* The **Knowledge Base** will be structured like a blog. Every article would precisely describe a bug/ vulnerability with valid examples to repicate, ways to mitigate, and external resources to read more about it.
* The **Checklist** would be a form. This form based on the key features of the smart-contract would sugest the dev to justify security against certain vulnerabilities. 
* Exact deliverables for this proposal would include seting up a structure for the knowledge base & checklist, having atleast 8 - 10 articles and their integration with the checklist. 
* More details about the proposal could be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/129MsSonsqp0SHAkqsmeXdIurUf7GiA33WsvrGerTIGE/edit).

Other Points to keep in mind:
- Keep the structure minimalistic 
- Keep everything OpenSource. This gives credebility to dOrg and creates the possibility to fund the project through Gitcoin Grants in future.  
- There is a possibility to create an auditing DAO in future
