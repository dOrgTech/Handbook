# DORG Token Redemption

**Author(s)**: @nestorbe

## Summary

Build the UI Client for the dOrg token redemption/staking contracts.

## Why should we fund this?

This project will give usability to the current dOrg token deployed contract. It will let the token holder redeem it for a choice of the preferred stablecoin, it will also enable the ability to stake the token to earn an APR based on the amount of dOrg token the holder commits to staking.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

This is my first project for dOrg and was completed between mid December and mid January.

Delivery: https://github.com/dOrgTech/token-redemption

## Cost

$2,000 USD + 2,000 DORG Tokens
