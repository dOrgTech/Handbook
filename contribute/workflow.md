# Workstreams

Anyone with [Rep](../our-organization/understanding-rep.md) is eligible to work on a workstream. Workstreams are the basic unit of organization in dOrg. Each workstream is specified in our private Github repo with the following elements:

1. **Title & Purpose** - the scope and basic goals
2. **Roles** - FTE allocations across specializations \(determines budget\)
3. **Roadmap** - deliverable deadlines and KPIs
4. **Client** - who the team is accountable to
5. **Payment Checkpoints** - predefined dates for reporting progress and distributing payments
6. \*\*\*\*[**Facilitator**](../how-to/payments-and-invoicing.md) - special role that handle payment proposals, client invoicing and other administrative tasks

For coordination, each workstream also can choose to set up a dedicated:

* Discord chat 
* Github project board
* Weekly stand-up
