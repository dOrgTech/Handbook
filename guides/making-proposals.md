# Making Proposals

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Financial" %}
Financial proposals compensate freelancers for work done or expenses incurred. 

| Name | Compensation for |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Checkpoint** | Contributing to any dOrg [workstream](../getting-started/workstreams.md) \(bimonthly\) |
| **Bounty** | Completing a funded [bounty](../contribute/onboarding.md) |
| **Bonus** | [On-boarding](growing.md) a new freelancer or funded project \(commission\) |
| **Reimbursement** | Incurring a [personal expense](bookkeeping-and-taxes.md) |

These proposals automatically transfer the requisite payment and Rep upon execution in the [Contribution Reward Scheme](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xbe1a98d3452f6da6e0984589e545d4fc25af7526/scheme/0x82523f624c8b894c2726ffec1064794b77e35a44c89f554d54e3bc4b595da81b).

Payments are denominated in USD but can include any mix of tokensâ€“ just make sure to note the spot price in the description! Financial proposals other than reimbursements should also include a Rep reward at the current [`rep-rate`](../our-organization/understanding-rep.md) \(currently 1 Rep per $200 equivalent\).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Legal" %}
Legal proposals enter dOrg, LLC into legally binding agreements with counterparties, such as:

* **Freelancers**: _Contractor Term Sheet_
* **Clients**: _Service Agreement_
* **Partners**: _Memorandum of Understanding_
* **Service Providers**: _Engagement Letter_

These proposals ratify written legal agreements, usually by linking a proposal \(in the [Contribution Reward Scheme](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xbe1a98d3452f6da6e0984589e545d4fc25af7526/scheme/0x82523f624c8b894c2726ffec1064794b77e35a44c89f554d54e3bc4b595da81b) with payments and Rep set to 0\) to the signed legal doc \(in a private repo\).

Agreements with dOrg, LLC only become legally binding upon a linked proposal passing.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Upgrades" %}
Upgrade Proposals modify the DAO's own code. Currently we can:

* Register a new scheme
* Unregister a scheme
* Edit a scheme

These proposals are made through the [Scheme Registrar](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xbe1a98d3452f6da6e0984589e545d4fc25af7526/scheme/0xc39042c0d9b05e9f1cd0a60626cc89271a08891c7081ad2c47d866df82200ad4). 
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Signaling" %}
Signaling proposals are used to ratify edits to official dOrg info, such as:

* Internal docs like the [budget](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/info/budget.md)
* Global variables like [`FTE-rate`](../our-organization/business-model.md) or [`rep-rate`](../our-organization/understanding-rep.md)\`\`
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

### Documentation

All proposal-related documentation lives in [this private dOrg repo](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations). The documentation protocol is as follows:

1. Make all changes \(add new payment checkpoint, add new legal doc, etc.\) in a separate branch
2. Open PR to master.
3. Make proposal\(s\) to the [DAO](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0xbe1a98d3452f6da6e0984589e545d4fc25af7526) that link to the PR.
4. If the proposals
   * Pass, merge the PR.
   * Fail, close the PR and start the process again.
