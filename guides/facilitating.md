# Facilitating

Each project has a dedicated facilitator who handles its administrative functions:

1. Maintaining the project budget and roadmap
2. Paying and checking in with freelancers 
3. Invoicing and communicating with the client

## Qualification & Compensation

In order to facilitate on a project, the following must be true:

* You are NOT an active contributor to this project
* You ARE an active contributor to at least one other dOrg project

The recommended compensation project facilitation is 5% of dOrg's [`FTE-rate`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/handbook/tree/0a72d59d518b1df0c2a1f7e2d2cab35dee4f2048/our-organization/understanding-compensation.md#full-time-equivalent-rate) This assumes a time commitment of ~8-12 hrs per month.

## Responsibilities

### Maintaining the Roadmap

At the start of a new workstream, the facilitator should prepare the [Workstream Spec](https://github.com/dOrgTech/handbook/tree/0a72d59d518b1df0c2a1f7e2d2cab35dee4f2048/contribute/workstreams.md). The facilitator is then responsible for making sure that the spec is updated at every checkpoint with work done by each freelancer and amounts paid out. Payment amounts should be made in-line with the budget and in relation to timely execution of roadmap deliverables.

### Paying Freelancers

At every payment checkpoint, the facilitator makes payment proposals to the DAO on behalf of each freelancer for work done.

### Invoicing Clients

4-7 days before every scheduled client payment, the facilitator sends an invoice to the client. The facilitator should also be the client's main point of contact for all administrative issues, such as legal docs and payment methods.
