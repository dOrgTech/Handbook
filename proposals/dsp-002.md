# Ops Roles

**Authors**: @orishim @magentaceiba @rihp

## Summary

Designate leads and fixed weekly budgets for three well-defined functional areas:

| Role | Description | Lead |
|-|-|-|
| [Admin](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CAuJaqNVZHKhL3dKWt7XWFSEE_gFWNdd1OJRGFuKE6o) | Maintain and improve systems for keeping dOrg’s finances and transactions healthy and transparent | Magenta |
| [Facilitation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NoAHVQxOONc7hHXk9H_lr6W8AuEv57hYii6cT6W-IC4) | Focus on ways to continuously enhance the dOrg builder experience | Ori |
| [Comms](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9yGypCxPLQxhSn7oZUU8cJ9gbqxze96MRKrK0FZQW8) | Keep dOrg’s external relationships and communication channels lively and growing | Roberto |

## Why should we fund this?

Having well-defined areas with leads will help us avoid diffusion of responsibilities for crucial operational tasks, while creating higher transparency for the entire organization of who is handling what.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

While each role has a lead, anyone from dOrg is welcome to contribute and earn from the role budgets.
