## Summary
For the following `dOrg Spending Proposal` (dsp) we plan to take on Internal Ops activities through three defined roles:
- Accounting
- Facilitation
- Communication 


## Why should we fund this?
This new approach will tackle the internal ops resposibilities by assinging lead roles to avoid the diffusion of efforts, while categorizing tasks in specific operation areas.

## Anything else you'd like to add?
The tasks will be recorded at the [Ops Repo](https://github.com/orgs/dOrgTech/projects/9)
Each role will have a dedicated lead. The duties for each role have been listed in the following documents.

### [Accounting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CAuJaqNVZHKhL3dKWt7XWFSEE_gFWNdd1OJRGFuKE6o/edit#): Magenta
> Maintain and improve systems for keeping dOrg’s finances and transactions healthy and transparent

### [Facilitation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NoAHVQxOONc7hHXk9H_lr6W8AuEv57hYii6cT6W-IC4): Ori
> Focus on ways to continuously enhance the dOrg builder experience

### [Communication](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1k9yGypCxPLQxhSn7oZUU8cJ9gbqxze96MRKrK0FZQW8/): Roberto
