# Website Redesign

**Author(s)**: @orishim

## Summary

Commission a website redesign and implementation through [99designs](https://99designs.com).

## Why should we fund this?

Our website needs to be up to date with our portfolio and how we work in order to keep attracting the best builders and clients.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

I've suggested a wireframe design [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1P7jeGETFRJBKlyXUjk9j9-QUUa8BctjFVSwMaIyev6M)

## Cost

Up to $3500
- $1500 - Design contest
- $2000 - Implementation with website builder

I will use this amount as the maximum budget and pay with my personal credit card then ask for reimbursement for the actual amount.
