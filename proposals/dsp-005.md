# Builder Referral Incentives 

**Author(s)**: @ronboger, @orishim

## Summary

Builder referral model that ties incentive to revenue generated by the referred builder. 

## Why should we fund this?

For dOrg to continue to provide high quality service and take on exciting projects, the organization needs to be able to attract and maintain top engineering talent.

## Anything else you'd like to add?

The incentive will be equivalent to 5% of the referred builder's first $100k earned from client work. dOrg makes 10 cents on every 80 cents earned by a builder on client work. In the case of a referred builder, dOrg would effectively be splitting this 10 cents with the referrer.

In order to simplify the tracking overhead, referral incentives will be payable to referrers at 4 milestones:
- $25k -> $1,250
- $50k -> $1,250
- $75k -> $1,250
- $100k -> $1,250
- MAX: $5,000 (5% of $100k)

Advantages of the model:
- The revenue generated by the referred builder pays for the referral incentive
- Simple to understand, account for, and track
- Pays out gradually, has caps so the costs are controlled
- Doesn't take money out of the referred builder's pocket

## Cost

5% of dOrg's 10% Margin on the first $50K of client work compensation earned by each newly referred builder (max $5K per new builder)
