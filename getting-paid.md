# Getting Paid

Each project has preset payment checkpoints for distributing compensation to builders.

1. At project kickoff, builders **enter claims in the** [**budget spreadsheet**](https://sheet.zoho.com/sheet/open/a4p9k334be0a1097242a3b83d72f227695a48) based on time commitments and task allocations.
2. As each payment checkpoint approaches, builders **adjust claims** based on actual work done.
3. Within 5 days of the checkpoint, **post** [**payment proposals**](https://airtable.com/shrSsOJJUoM6N6IKL) to the DAO.

The execution lead ensures that builders enter and adjust claims on time. The lead can also submit payment proposals on behalf of builders if they prefer.

## Dealing with Conflict

Paying yourself in a decentralized organization is not always straightforward! 

* **If you expect your claim to deviate significantly** from what was originally agreed upon, let the rest of the squad know as soon as possible. Avoid quietly over or under working! By communicating openly and transparently, work allocations and payment expectations can be adjusted without conflict.
* **If conflict arises**, try to understand where each person is coming from and reach a negotiated agreement. Discuss the source of conflict with the builder squad and how to avoid it in the future. 
* **If local consensus cannot be reached**, the wider DAO can ultimately decide on the final payment allocation.
