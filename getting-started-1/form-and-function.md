# Form & Function

After gestating as a multisig, dOrg mutated into a reputation-weighted DAO with legal personality.

Since then some basic metabolic processes have emerged.

### Membership Membrane

Agents join by completing an activation challenge. Agents deactivate after 3 months of inactivity but can always reactivate.

### Project Pollination

Agents seed new client projects and collect commissions upon fertilization.

### Sustenance & Governance

Agents working on **external projects** divide up the income minus a tax that sustains **internal projects**.

Agents accumulate **voting power** in proportion to dollars earned and **tokens** in proportion to dollars deferred. Tokens represent redeemable claims on net assets.
