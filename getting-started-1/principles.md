# Principles

As dOrg continues to evolve, guiding principles are taking root.

### Freedom & Support

Enjoy the freedoms of independent contracting without sacrificing the support structures of employment.

### Act first, Ask later

Just try things rather than seeking permission. Very few mistakes are fatal or irreversible, so if you want to start or change something, go ahead! 

### Meritocracy

No titles, managers, or reporting structures. Your power to influence stuff is based on competence and engagement.

### Simple Models

Prefer simplicity over detailed mechanisms. Better to have too few rules than too many, and better to follow high-level principles than low-level procedures.
