# Principles

As dOrg continues to evolve, guiding principles are taking root.

### Freedom & Support

Maintain the freedoms of independent contracting without sacrificing the support structures of employment.

### Act first, Ask later

If you want to start or change something, go ahead! Very few mistakes are fatal or irreversible, so just try things rather than seeking permission.

### Meritocracy

No titles, managers, or reporting structures. Your power to influence stuff is based on competence and engagement.

### Simple Models

Err on the side of simplicity rather than coming up with detailed mechanisms for every problem. Better to have too few rules than too many, and better to follow high-level principles than low-level procedures.
