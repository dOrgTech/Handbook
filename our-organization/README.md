# Our Organization

## dOrg is a self-organizing Ethereum development agency.

We govern ourselves through smart contracts and build tools that help others to do the same.

Every aspect of our organization is driven by web3â€“ from [legal structure](ownership-and-governance.md) and [membership](../getting-started/bounties.md), to [budgeting](../getting-started/budget-blocks.md) and [governance dynamics](understanding-rep.md), to the [tools we use](../working-together/tool-stack.md) and the [software we build](https://github.com/dOrgTech).
