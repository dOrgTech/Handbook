# Our Organization

### dOrg is a web3 freelancers cooperative.

We strive to empower others with web3 technologies and worker-owned models that challenge big tech and the gig economy.

Every aspect of our organization is driven by [web3 values](values-and-operating-principles.md)â€“ from [legal structure](ownership-and-governance.md) and [governance](ownership-and-governance.md), to [on-boarding](../getting-started/bounties.md) and [budgeting](../getting-started/budget-blocks.md) practices, to the [tools we use](../working-together/tool-stack.md) and the [software we build](https://github.com/dOrgTech).
