# Business Model

dOrg generates revenue by providing high value web3 development services to its clients. This revenue is used to:

1. **Compensate freelancers** who help deliver client value– developers, designers, facilitators
2. **Cover overhead** such as legal, accounting and software subscription fees
3. **Research & develop** improvements to the model, including new products and services
4. **Reward Rep holders** with benefits and \(eventually\) dividends

## Full-Time Equivalent Rate

Freelancer compensation is scaled to dOrg's current `FTE-Rate`. The `FTE-Rate` is defined as the dollar equivalent compensation an individual freelancer should expect in a month's timeframe when working full-time on dOrg projects. 

For example, a freelancer committing a quarter of their working hours in a given month to dOrg should expect to receive `FTE-Rate/4` dollar equivalent in compensation– summed across all of their payment proposals during that period.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The `FTE-Rate` is an internal value that is known to all dOrg agents but not known publicly.

dOrg Rep holders can view the current rate [here](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/info/budget.md).
{% endhint %}

### Change Over Time

`FTE-Rate` is socially-enforced and can be modified by the DAO over time. As margins on client projects increase, for example, the DAO might decide to do any combination of the following:

* Increase `FTE-Rate`
* Reinvest in efforts that generate future value– such as recruitment & sales, pro bono DAO advisory, or ecosystem tooling
* Distribute surplus to Rep holders as benefits or dividends
