# Understanding Rep

At the most basic level, **your Reputation score represents your decision-making power**.  Each person's voting weight is equivalent to their Rep. Rep is non-transferable and can only be minted and burned by the dOrg DAO.

But in dOrg, Reputation is much more than voting weight– it's our fundamental unit of account. Rep is continuously distributed to freelancers and confers legal protections as well as ownership rights over dOrg, LLC. In fact, the LLC is entirely owned by the Rep holders. It's all on-chain baby!

## Earning Rep

Rep is continuously minted to freelancers in proportion to dollar equivalent earned. **The more dOrg pays you, the more Rep you accumulate**. This means that your power grows or shrinks in proportion to the cumulative value you add relative to others. 

The `rep-rate` is currently set to 1 Rep per $200 earned.

### `rep-rate` = 1 Rep / $200 Earned
{% endhint %}

### Change Over Time

The rate is socially-enforced and can be modified by the DAO in the future. For example, the DAO might decide to increase the rate to $220, essentially raising the "difficulty" for future freelancers by 10%.

The DAO could even decide to give Rep to stakeholder groups other than freelancers, such as investors \(e.g. 1 Rep per $1500 contributed\), strategic partners, or users of our products. Such mechanisms would need to be carefully designed to ensure plutocracy resistance and regulatory compliance.

The DAO can also vote to slash someone's Rep for violating any dOrg [Agreement](../working-together/agreements.md).

## Using Rep

So what is Rep actually used for? Mostly to vote on financial and legal decisions.

* _Financial Proposals_ to compensate freelancers for work done or reimburse expenses.
* _Legal Proposals_ to enter dOrg, LLC into legal agreements with counterparties– including new freelancers, clients, partners and service providers.

Learn about how to make these and other types of proposals in [Making Proposals](../how-to/making-proposals.md).

### Future Uses

As our tooling evolves, the DAO could be used to govern other shared resources, such as our landing page or code repositories.

We also intend to expand the utility of Rep beyond voting– offering holders a variety of benefits, such as:

* Co-working reimbursements
* Travel to conferences
* Education & up-skilling
* Health Insurance
* Paid vacation
* Dividends

As the world's first on-chain legal entity, we feel well positioned to pioneer benefits for freelancer DAOs.

## Legal & Tax Implications

All Rep holders are legal owners of dOrg, LLC. By controlling an address that holds Rep in dOrg, you agree to be bound by our [Operating Agreement](../working-together/agreements.md). As an owner, you are also protected from personal liability for dOrg's actions. 

Because dOrg primarily serves as a means of allocating work and compensation to freelancers, we do not anticipate profit distributions to owners \(Rep holders\) at this time– so holding Rep does not have any tax implications in itself.

However, you are responsible for paying self-employment tax to your local authorities on compensation earned in your capacity as an independent contractor of dOrg \(see [Bookkeeping & Taxes](../guides/bookkeeping-and-taxes.md) for further guidance\).

To summarize, all **dOrg freelancers are both owners and independent contractors** of dOrg, LLC **and have limited liability** as a result. See [Agreements](../working-together/agreements.md) for more details.
