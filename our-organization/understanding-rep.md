# Understanding Rep

At the most basic level, **your Reputation score represents your decision-making power**. Each person's voting weight is equivalent to their Rep. Rep is non-transferable and can only be minted and burned by the dOrg DAO.

But in dOrg, Reputation is much more than voting weight– it's our fundamental unit of account. Rep is continuously distributed to freelancers and confers legal protections as well as ownership rights over dOrg, LLC. In fact, the LLC is entirely owned by the Rep holders.

## Earning Rep

Rep is continuously minted to freelancers in proportion to dollar equivalent earned. **The more dOrg pays you, the more Rep you accumulate**. This means that your power grows or shrinks in proportion to the cumulative value you add relative to others.

The current `rep-rate` is defined in our [`org.json`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/org.json) \(protected\).

{% hint style="danger" %}
`rep-rate`is socially-enforced and can be amended by the DAO at any time. 

For example, the DAO might decide to raise the "difficulty" by lowering the rate \(say, from 0.005 Rep per $ earned to 0.004\). The DAO could also mint Rep for stakeholder groups other than freelancers– such as investors \(e.g. 0.001 Rep per $ contributed\), strategic partners, or users of our products.

The DAO can also slash anyone's Rep for violating one of the [Agreements](../working-together/agreements.md).

## Using Rep

So what is Rep actually used for? Mostly to vote on financial and legal decisions.

* _Financial Proposals_ to compensate agents for work done or reimburse expenses.
* _Legal Proposals_ to enter dOrg, LLC into legal agreements with counter-parties

The DAO also has a Rep threshold for administration of operational tooling like our chat or email clients– defined in our [`org.json`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/org.json) \(protected\).

### Looking Ahead

As our tooling evolves, the DAO can be used to govern other shared resources, including:

* _Off-chain Data_: software libraries, databases, web apps
* _Physical Assets_: real-estate, hardware

We can also expand the utility of Rep beyond voting and admin privileges– offering benefits, dividends or insurance to different tiers of Rep holders.

## Legal & Tax Implications

All Rep holders are legal owners of dOrg, LLC. By controlling an address that holds Rep in dOrg, you agree to be bound by our [Operating Agreement](../working-together/agreements.md). As an owner, you are also protected from personal liability for dOrg's actions.

Because dOrg primarily serves as a means of allocating work and compensation to freelancers, we do not anticipate profit distributions to owners \(Rep holders\) at this time– so holding Rep does not have any tax implications in itself.

However, you are responsible for paying self-employment tax to your local authorities on compensation earned in your capacity as an independent contractor of dOrg.

To summarize, all **dOrg freelancers are both owners and independent contractors** of dOrg, LLC **and have limited liability** as a result. See [Agreements](../working-together/agreements.md) for more details.
