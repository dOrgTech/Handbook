# Understanding Rep

At the most basic level, **your Reputation score represents your decision-making power**. Each person's voting weight is equivalent to their Rep. Rep is non-transferable and can only be minted and burned by the dOrg DAO.

But in dOrg, Reputation is much more than voting weight– it's our fundamental unit of account. Rep is continuously distributed to freelancers and confers legal protections as well as ownership rights over dOrg, LLC. **In fact, the LLC is entirely owned by the Rep holders**.

## Earning Rep

Rep is continuously minted to freelancers in proportion to dollar equivalent earned. **The more dOrg pays you, the more Rep you accumulate**. This means that your power grows or shrinks in proportion to the cumulative value you add relative to others.

The current `rep-rate` is defined in our [`org.json`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/org.json) \(protected\).

{% hint style="warning" %}
`rep-rate`is socially-enforced and can be amended by the DAO at any time. 

For example, the DAO might decide to raise the "difficulty" by lowering the rate \(say, from 0.005 to 0.004 Rep per dollar earned\). The DAO could also mint Rep for stakeholder groups other than freelancers– such as investors, strategic partners, or users of our products.

{% hint style="warning" %}
The DAO can slash anyone's Rep at any time for violating any [Agreements](../working-together/agreements.md).

## Using Rep

So how is Rep actually used? Mostly by voting on financial and legal decisions.

* _Financial Proposals_ to compensate agents for work done or reimburse expenses.
* _Legal Proposals_ to enter dOrg, LLC into binding agreements with counter-parties

The DAO also has a Rep threshold for administration of operational tooling like our chat or email clients. `admin-thresh` is defined in our [`org.json`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/org.json) \(protected\).

### Looking Ahead

As our tooling evolves, the DAO can be used to govern other shared resources, such as:

* _Off-Chain Data_: software libraries, databases, web apps
* _Physical Assets_: real-estate, hardware

We can also expand the utility of Rep beyond voting and admin privileges– offering different tiers of benefits, dividend rights or insurance policies.

## Legal & Tax Implications

All Rep holders are legal owners of dOrg, LLC. By controlling an address that holds Rep in the dOrg DAO, you agree to be bound by our [Operating Agreement](../working-together/agreements.md). As an owner, you are shielded from personal liability for dOrg's actions.

dOrg is taxed as a corporation \(rather than a pass-through partnership\), meaning that the individual owners do not pay taxes for its retained earnings. See [Admin](../working-together/admin.md) for more details.
