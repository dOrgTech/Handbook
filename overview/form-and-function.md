# Form & Function

After gestating as a multisig, dOrg mutated into a reputation-weighted [DAO](../glossary/web3.md#dao) with legal personality.

Since then some basic metabolic processes have emerged.

### Builder Lifecycle

Anyone can join by submitting an [activation challenge](../lifecycle/activation.md). Builders [deactivate](../lifecycle/deactivation.md) after 90 days of inactivity but can always reactivate.

### Core Workflows

Builders collaboratively [find projects](../finding-projects.md), [execute on deliverables](../working-on-projects.md), and [get paid through the DAO](../getting-paid.md).

### Governance

The margin on paid projects grow the DAO's [savings](../how-dorg-works/value-flow.md), which builders control through [voting and redemption rights](../how-dorg-works/voting-power.md) accumulated over time. Builders also govern all legal decisions and [organization-wide parameters](../how-dorg-works/global-variables.md).
