# Form & Function

After gestating as a multisig, dOrg mutated into a reputation-weighted [DAO](../resources/glossary.md#dao) with legal personality.

Since then some basic metabolic processes have emerged.

### Agent Lifecycle

Anyone can join by completing an [activation challenge](../lifecycle/activation.md). Agents [deactivate](../lifecycle/deactivation.md) after 90 days of inactivity but can always reactivate.

### Core Workflows

Agents earn by sourcing or working on [client projects](../workflows/client-work.md). The margin on client projects funds [internal operations](../workflows/internal-ops.md).

### Governance

Agents accumulate [voting power](../governance/voting-power.md#reputation-rep) in proportion to dollars earned and [tokens](../governance/voting-power.md#dorg-tokens) ****in proportion to dollars deferred.
