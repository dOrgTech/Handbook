[Web3](../glossary/web3.md#web3) is a foundational coordination technology that will empower humans to better their worlds.

But weâ€™re not there yet. The web3 stack is immature and lacks robust tools and real-world experiments. dOrg spawned at the start of 2019 to change all that.

Its genetic code is simple:

1. **Run on web3.**

   Cultivate a technical agency that utilizes web3 to operate. Develop solutions to challenges along the way.

2. **Build on web3.**

   Execute on projects that advance the stack: digital identity, accountable fundraising, decentralized liquidity, developer tools, friendly UIs.

3. **Iterate and propagate.**

   As web3 matures and gains traction, widen the fold: journalists, filmmakers, plumbers, nurses, construction workers, educators.
