# Internal Ops

The margin on client projects sustains internal operations.

![](../.gitbook/assets/heartbeat.gif)

Internal operations encompass activities, such as:

* Refining or automating internal workflows
* Creating videos, articles or other content
* Updating the landing page or handbook
* Administrative work \(billing, legal, bookkeeping, taxes\)
* Treasury management \(lending, swaps, investments\)
* Research & development

The DAO distributes internal ops rewards and expense reimbursements through proposals according to the budgeting protocol.

### Budgeting Protocol

Before the 5th of each month, the DAO passes a proposal outlining the upcoming month's budget.

### $$Budget = {balance_i + revenues_e-expenses_e \over runway}$$ 

* $$balance_i:$$ Initial treasury balance 
* $$revenues_e:$$ Expected revenues from client project margins
* $$expenses_e:$$ Expected 3rd party expenses
* $$runway:$$ Months to stretch the treasury

In the same proposal, the DAO approves the previous month's budget distribution, which outlines each agent's rewards.

### $$rewards_x = hours_x \times {Budget \over \sum hours}$$ 

* $$hours_x  :$$ Hours worked by agent$$x$$
* $$Budget  :$$ Total budget available this month
* $$\sum hours$$ Total hours worked by all agents this month
