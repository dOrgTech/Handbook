# Client Projects

dOrg generates revenue through client projects.

Agents can earn both by working on project deliverables and sourcing new projects.

The default distribution of project revenue is 10% for sourcing, 75% for working,  and 15% as dOrg's margin. The distribution can vary based on the **Project Specification** approved by the DAO.

The **Project Specification** specifies details like the scope of services, milestone and payment schedule, agent revenue distribution, and legal terms.
{% endhint %}

The DAO distributes payouts for working and sourcing through proposals after each client payment.

2. Follow-up with a **Project Proposal**
3. Share details with agents and assemble a squad
4. Submit **Project Specification** to the DAO for acceptance

### Working

75 % of project revenues are allocated amongst the agent\(s\) who:

* Deliver what was promised on time
* Participate in internal and client-facing calls and chats
