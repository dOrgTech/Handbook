# Client Projects

dOrg generates revenue through client projects.

Agents can earn both by working on project deliverables and sourcing new projects.

The default distribution of project revenue is 10% for sourcing, 75% for working, and 15% as dOrg's margin. The distribution can vary based on the **Project Specification** approved by the DAO.

{% hint style="info" %}
The **Project Specification** specifies details like the scope of services, milestone and payment schedule, agent revenue distribution, and legal terms.
{% endhint %}

The DAO distributes payouts for working and sourcing through proposals after each client payment.

## Sourcing

Up to 10% of project revenues are allocated amongst the agent\(s\) who:

1. Initiate contact and schedule intake meeting with the client
2. Follow-up with a **Project Proposal**
3. Share details with agents and assemble a squad
4. Submit **Project Specification** to the DAO for acceptance

## Working

Agents outline work allocations at the start of a project.

These allocations are represented as a fraction of a full time commitment of 1.

Agents may elect to receive a portion of their payout in DORG Tokens.

| Budget | $75,000 |  | Gaston | 1.0 | 80% | 30000 | 24000 | $6,000 |
{% endhint %}

At the end of the project, agents discuss any adjustments based on actual work done.

Squads are collectively responsible for distributing the work as appropriate to match the expected allocations.

75 % of project revenues are allocated amongst the agent\(s\) who:

* Deliver what was promised on time
* Participate in internal and client-facing calls and chats
