# Client Projects

dOrg generates revenue through client projects.

Agents can earn both by working on project deliverables and sourcing new projects.

The default distribution of project revenue is 10% for sourcing, 80% for building, and 10% as dOrg's margin. The distribution can vary based on the **Project Specification** approved by the DAO.

The **Project Specification** specifies details like the scope of services, milestone and payment schedule, agent revenue distribution, and legal terms.
{% endhint %}

The DAO distributes payouts for sourcing and building through proposals after each client payment.

## Sourcing

Up to 10% of project revenues are allocated amongst the agent\(s\) who:

1. Initiate contact and schedule intake meeting with the client
2. Follow-up with a **Project Proposal**
3. Share details with agents and assemble a squad
4. Submit **Project Specification** to the DAO for acceptance

## Building

80% of project revenues are allocated amongst the agent\(s\) who:

* Deliver what was promised on time
* Participate in internal and client-facing calls and chats

Agents outline work allocations at the start of a project, where 1.0 represents one full-time equivalent. The agents on the project then distribute the work to match the expected allocations as closely as possible. At the end of the project, agents discuss any adjustments based on actual work done before making payment proposals to the DAO.
