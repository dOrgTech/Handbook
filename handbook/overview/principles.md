# Principles

As dOrg continues to evolve, guiding principles are taking root.

### Freedom & Support

Maintain the freedoms of freelancing without sacrificing the support structures of employment.

### Bias towards Action

If you want to start or change something, go ahead! Mistakes are usually reversible, so just try things rather than seeking permission.

### Meritocracy

No titles, special privileges, or hierarchical structures. Influence is based on competence and engagement.

### Simple Models

Strive for simplicity over detailed mechanisms. Better to follow high-level principles than low-level procedures.
