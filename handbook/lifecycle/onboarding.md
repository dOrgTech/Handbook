# Onboarding

Once your activation proposal passes, you will be onboarded.

## Onboarding Session

A dOrg builder will reach out to schedule an onboarding call, where we will:

* Get to know each other
* Answer any questions you have
* Find out how you can contribute to ongoing projects and upcoming opportunities

{% hint style="info" %}
### Tips for your session

* [x] Tell us more about your background, what you do and what inspires you
* [x] Propose new ideas
* [x] Challenge existing paradigms
* [x] Ask thoughtful questions
* [x] Share any feedback about your experience thus far
{% endhint %}

## Internal Spaces

You will also be added to the tools and events that keep dOrg builders in sync.

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Keybase" %}
![Keybase is an encrypted messaging system, similar to Slack, Discord, or IRC.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2819%29%20%281%29.png)

In addition to the [public chat](https://keybase.io/team/dorg.membrane), dOrg has a [private chat](https://keybase.io/team/dorg) to coordinate asynchronously.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="GitHub" %}
![Github is a platform for streamlined version control of projects.](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2833%29.png)

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Airtable" %}
![Airtable bases are like spreadsheets with database superpowers](../.gitbook/assets/imagen%20%289%29.png)

Sign-in to Airtable with your @dorg.tech email address and request access to the [Nucleus base](https://airtable.com/tblufTXr6zuUl1Aml), where we track projects, transactions and more. Then check out the [Signals base](https://airtable.com/tbl5wOpNW0pcgwiQW) to discover meeting notes, brand assets, and feedback forms.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Alchemy" %}
![Alchemy is a web portal for interacting with the DAOstack protocol.](../.gitbook/assets/imagen%20%281%29.png)

This is where you submit and vote on **proposals**, view **reputation** scores, and monitor the DAO's **treasury**.

Due to Ethereum gas costs, we have both a [mainnet](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x15344ecdc2c4edfcb092e284d93c20f0529fd8a6/members/) and [xDAI](https://alchemy-xdai.herokuapp.com/dao/0x94a587478c83491b13291265581cb983e7feb540) DAO.
