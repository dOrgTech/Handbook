## 4. Wait for the Votes!

Now that your proposal is submitted, dOrg builders will review and vote. Proposals are typically processed in 2 - 7 days.

If your proposal passes, you will receive **100 xDAI** + **100 Rep** and move on to [Onboarding](onboarding.md).

## 5. Redeem your Proposal

![Don&apos;t forget to Redeem your proposal after it passes!](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-26-at-4.30.04-pm%20%281%29.png)

If the DAO rejects your proposal, don't worry â€“ you can always try again! Currently we expect a steady growth of 1-2 builders per month.

To redeem your proposal, you will need to:

1. Click the "Redeem for beneficiary" and follow the prompts on your wallet
2. Use the [xDAI bridge](https://dai-bridge.poa.network/) to transfer your xDAI to Ethereum Mainnet
3. Optionally cash out through your cryptocurrency exchange of choice

{% hint style="info" %}
Choose a [cryptocurrency exchange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_exchange), such as [Coinbase](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/buying-selling-or-converting-crypto/how-do-i-sell-or-cash-out-my-digital-currency) or [Uphold](http://uphold.com/), that works best with your preferred bank and country of origin.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
If you have any trouble with the xDAI bridge, reach out or follow the steps below to troubleshoot:

1. Confirm your xDAI has been burned by following the transaction [here](https://explorer.anyblock.tools/ethereum/poa/xdai/)
2. If it's taking too long to complete \(more than 12 hours\) check the - \`balanceDiff\`\` value in the [xDAI bridge monitoring API](https://bridge-monitoring.poa.net/xdai). The value of this variable indicates how much money has not been yet transferred between the mainnet and the xDAI chains.
3. Check [the Mainnet bridge contract's address in etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x4aa42145aa6ebf72e164c9bbc74fbd3788045016#tokentxns) and verify the status of the recent ERC20 transactions. There should be no reverted or pending transactions.
4. If there are pending transactions and you xDAI was burned over 12 hours ago, ask for help in [Discord](https://discord.gg/6Kujmad). Remember to link to the transactions, and we'll give you a hand.
