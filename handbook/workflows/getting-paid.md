# Getting Paid

Projects have preset checkpoints for distributing compensation to builders.

1. At project kickoff, the execution lead **sets up the** [**budget spreadsheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwYhzTNXSytzVtACZLu1V_EVTfjPKhGfHu-KhnBFESk) outlining all checkpoints
2. As each checkpoint approaches, builders **enter compensation claims** based on time worked and tasks completed.
3. Within 5 days of each checkpoint, the execution lead **posts compensation proposals** to the DAO.

### How to post payment

We plan to streamline this!

1. Ensure that builders adjust claims until consensus is reached
2. Individually enter each builder's [**compensation request**](https://airtable.com/shrSsOJJUoM6N6IKL) into the Airtable form, which will redirect to Alchemy
3. Post each payment proposal in Alchemy, with
   * Title: "Project Name - Milestone \# - Builder Name"
   * Description: link to the  budget spreadsheet
   * URL: auto-filled with link to the compensation request record in Airtable \(if there is an issue with the redirect, find the record in the [Transactions table](https://airtable.com/tblMrDMxVayppGF9m/viwhqSpGsDo4i9pkA?blocks=hide) and right click to copy\) 
   * Recipient: find the builderâ€™s ETH address in the [Entities](https://airtable.com/tblZc3HquQ9JWZ5BI/viwDDK5AkfDtTSC45?blocks=hide) table 
   * Enter the amount of xDAI, DXRG \(if builder is claiming payment partially in dOrg's token\), and Reputation \(xDAI + DXRG\)

## Dealing with Conflict

Paying yourself in a decentralized organization is not always straightforward!

* **If you expect your claim to deviate significantly** from what was originally agreed upon, let the rest of the squad know as soon as possible. Avoid quietly over or under working! By communicating openly and transparently, work allocations and payment expectations can be adjusted without conflict.
* **If conflict arises**, try to understand where each person is coming from and reach a negotiated agreement. Discuss the source of conflict with the builder squad and how to avoid it in the future. 
* **If local consensus cannot be reached**, the wider DAO can ultimately decide on the final payment allocation.
