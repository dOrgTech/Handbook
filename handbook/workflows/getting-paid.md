# Getting Paid

Projects have preset checkpoints for distributing compensation to builders.

1. At project kickoff, the coordinator **sets up the** [**budget sheet**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mwYhzTNXSytzVtACZLu1V_EVTfjPKhGfHu-KhnBFESk) outlining all checkpoints
2. As each checkpoint approaches, builders **enter compensation claims** based on time worked and tasks completed.
3. Once builders have reached consensus, each builder **posts a compensation proposal to** [**Alchemy**](https://alchemy.daostack.io/dao/0x94a587478c83491b13291265581cb983e7feb540/scheme/0xca275b54cf9e9afc2317778e3e294e01a5b25ce9e082043b64a5cc7f4c4ec2f9)**:**

| Field | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| Title | \[Project Name\] - \[Period\] - \[Builder Name\] |
| Description | URL of budget sheet |
| Recipient | Your ETH address \(same one you activated with\) |
| Reputation | Equivalent to the value in the "Amount" column on the budget sheet |
| xDAI | Same as Reputation, unless you elect to receive a portion of your payout in DXRG |
| DXRG | Portion of your payout that you want to receive in DXRG \(1 DXRG = 1 xDAI\) |

{% hint style="info" %}
For every compensation proposal, `Reputation = xDAI + DXRG`
{% endhint %}

## Dealing with Conflict

Paying yourself in a decentralized organization is not always straightforward!

* **If you expect your claim to deviate significantly** from what was originally agreed upon, let the project coordinator know know as soon as possible. Avoid quietly over or under working! By communicating openly and transparently, expectations can be adjusted without conflict.
* **If conflict arises**, try to understand where each person is coming from and reach a mutually agreeable outcome. Leverage the project's coordinator and the rest of the builder squad to help. 
* **If local consensus cannot be reached**, the wider DAO can ultimately decide on the final payment allocation.
