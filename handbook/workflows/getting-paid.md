# Getting Paid

Each project has preset payment checkpoints for distributing compensation to builders.

1. At project kickoff, builders **enter claims in the** [**budget spreadsheet**](https://sheet.zoho.com/sheet/open/a4p9k334be0a1097242a3b83d72f227695a48) based on time commitments and task allocations.
2. As each payment checkpoint approaches, builders **adjust claims** based on actual work done.
3. Within 5 days of the checkpoint, **post payment proposals** to the DAO.

The execution lead ensures that builders enter and adjust claims on time. The lead can also submit payment proposals on behalf of builders if they prefer.

### How to post payment
We plan to streamline this!

1. **Post** [**payment request**](https://airtable.com/shrSsOJJUoM6N6IKL) via the Airtable form. (Make sure claims are adjusted - double check with people before putting the proposal in.)
2. **Post payment proposal** in Alchemy
* Title field: Project Name - Milestone # - Builder Name
* Description: link to the budget spreadsheet
* URL: link to the payment request record in airtable. To find this, go to Transactions in Airtable, the Compensation view, and right click on the invoice ID. 
* Recipient: To find the builder’s ETH address, go to the Entities tab in Airtable and click on the Builder view.
* Enter the amount of xDAI to be paid, and DXRG if the builder is claiming payment partially in dOrg’s token.

## Dealing with Conflict

Paying yourself in a decentralized organization is not always straightforward!

* **If you expect your claim to deviate significantly** from what was originally agreed upon, let the rest of the squad know as soon as possible. Avoid quietly over or under working! By communicating openly and transparently, work allocations and payment expectations can be adjusted without conflict.
* **If conflict arises**, try to understand where each person is coming from and reach a negotiated agreement. Discuss the source of conflict with the builder squad and how to avoid it in the future. 
* **If local consensus cannot be reached**, the wider DAO can ultimately decide on the final payment allocation.
