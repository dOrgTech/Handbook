# Finding a Project

## Join a project

Builders can monitor the \#project-funnel channel in Discord for upcoming opportunities.

To join an ongoing project, get in touch with the coordinator listed in the project's pinned message on Discord. 

## Source a new project

You can also earn up to 10% in sourcing commission by completing the following steps:

1. Initiate contact and schedule an intake meeting with the prospective client.
2. Follow-up with a **Proposal**.
3. Share details with builders in \#project-funnel chat and weekly call.
4. Assemble builder squad and finalize details with the client.
5. Submit the **Services Agreement** to the DAO and client for signing.
