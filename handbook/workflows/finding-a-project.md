# Finding a Project

## Join an upcoming project

Builders can monitor the following channels for new opportunities:

* \#project-funnel channel in [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/6Kujmad),
* Weekly project funnel call

If a project interests you, get in touch with its coordination or sourcing lead.

## Source a new project

You can also earn up to 10% in sourcing commission by completing the following steps:

1. Initiate contact and schedule an intake meeting with the prospective client.
2. Follow-up with a **Proposal**.
3. Share details with builders in \#project-funnel chat and weekly call.
4. Assemble builder squad and finalize details with the client.
5. Submit the **Services Agreement** to the DAO and client for signing.
