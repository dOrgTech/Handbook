{% endhint %}

### 2. Fill out the Form

Fill out this [Join Form](https://dorg.tech/join/).  

### 3. Submit Proposal

Submitting the join form will redirect you to an auto-generated proposal to the DAO. Make sure to update the proposal with your

* [x] **Name** in the _Title_
* [x] **Link to your creation** in the _Description_
* [x] **Ethereum address** as the _Recipient_

{% hint style="info" %}
You'll need an Ethereum [wallet](../glossary/web3.md#wallet) like Metamask installed in your browser with some [xDAI](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Handbook/blob/ad57e0b6e99013e3d6a88ba5f379666cfb7715f6/glossary/web3.md#xdai-network) in order to submit the proposal transaction. 
{% endhint %}

### 4. Wait for the Votes!

Now that your proposal is submitted, dOrg agents will review and vote. Proposals are typically processed in 2 - 7 days.

If your proposal passes, you will receive **100 xDAI** + **100 Rep** and move on to [Onboarding](onboarding.md).

![Don&apos;t forget to Redeem your proposal after it passes!](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-26-at-4.30.04-pm%20%281%29.png)

If the DAO rejects your proposal, don't worry â€“ you can always try again! Currently we expect a steady growth of 1-2 agents per month.
