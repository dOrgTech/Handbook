## 1. Create

Create ****something that **enables decentralized organizations**.

* **Mini-hackathon**: Explore ideas in any domain 
* Finish within **1 day.**

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Ideas & Support

Reach out on [Keybase](https://keybase.io/team/dorg.membrane) to brainstorm or ask questions. Here are some ideas:

* **Visualization** of dOrg's reputation distribution, proposals or cash flow
* Simple **front end** for interacting with the dOrg DAO
* Minimum viable DAO **smart contract** or other novel mechanism applicable to DAOs
* Wire frame **design** for a new DAO dashboard
* **Product** spec for a new web3 tool
* Short **research** report on DAO frameworks
* **Business development** roadmap for DAO adoption in a particular sector/use-case
* Article, video, artwork or any type of **content** that explains DAOs or dOrg to a general audience.

Check out [these sample submissions](https://github.com/dOrgTech/activation-challenge-examples) for more.
{% endhint %}

## 2. Check the Boxes

Make sure to do the following before moving on: 

* [x] Fill out the [Join Form](https://dorg.tech/join/)
* [x] Read the [Operating Agreement](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ecosystem/blob/master/legal/Operating_Agreement.pdf) and [Contractor Agreement](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ecosystem/blob/master/legal/Contractor_Term_Sheet.pdf)
* [x] Email your [W-8BEN](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw8ben.pdf) \(non-US\) or [W-9](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/fw9.pdf) \(US\) to [notices@dorg.tech](mailto:notices@dorg.tech)

{% hint style="warning" %}
**W8-BEN** / **W9** forms are needed for tax reporting purposes. This information is forwarded to dOrg's professional accounting provider and will never be seen by other DAO members.
{% endhint %}

## 3. Submit

Submit your proposal directly to the DAO with [this template](https://tinyurl.com/ydy2pojc). Make sure to include your:

* [x] **Name** in the _Title_
* [x] **Proof of Work** in the _Description_
* [x] **Ethereum address** as the _Beneficiary_

{% hint style="warning" %}
You'll need an Ethereum [wallet](../resources/glossary.md#wallet) with some [gas](../resources/glossary.md#gas) installed in your browser in order to submit the proposal transaction.
{% endhint %}

## 4. Wait for the Votes!

Now that your proposal is submitted, dOrg agents will review and vote. Proposals are typically processed in 2 - 7 days. 

If your proposal passes, you will receive **100 USDC** + **100 Rep** and move on to [Onboarding](onboarding.md).

![Don&apos;t forget to Redeem your proposal after it passes!](../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-06-26-at-4.30.04-pm%20%281%29.png)

If the DAO rejects your proposal, don't worry â€“ there will be other chances to join dOrg! Currently we expect a steady growth of one or two agents a month. [Reach out](https://keybase.io/team/dorg.membrane) to find out how to improve your chances.
