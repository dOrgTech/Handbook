# Onboarding

Once your activation proposal passes, you will be onboarded.

### Onboarding Session

A dOrg agent will reach out to schedule an onboarding call, where we will:

* Get to know each other
* Answer any questions you have
* Find out how your skills and interests can contribute to our workflows, ongoing projects, and upcoming opportunities

{% hint style="info" %}
#### Tips for your session

* [x] Tell us more about your background, what you do and what inspires you
* [x] Propose new ideas
* [x] Challenge existing paradigms
* [x] Ask thoughtful questions
* [x] Share any feedback about your experience thus far
{% endhint %}
