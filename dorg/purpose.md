### dOrg is a full-stack freelancer agency building and running on web3.

Web3 will empower humans to better their worlds by serving as a foundation for new coordination technologies.

But weâ€™re not there yet. The web3 stack is immature and lacks a robust ecosystem of tools and experiments. dOrg spawned at the start of 2019 to change all that.

Its genetic code is simple:

1. **Run on web3.**



   Cultivate a technical agency that utilizes web3 to operate. Develop solutions to challenges along the way.

2. **Build on web3.**



   Execute on projects that advance the stack: digital identity, accountable fundraising, decentralized liquidity, developer tools, friendly UIs.

3. **Iterate and propagate.**

   \_\_

   As web3 matures and gains traction, widen the fold: journalists, filmmakers, plumbers, nurses, construction workers, educators.
