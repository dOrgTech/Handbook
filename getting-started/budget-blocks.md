# Budget Blocks

dOrg contributors are compensated on a block reward model. The block reward is calculated as the sum total of all revenues minus fixed expenses since the previous block. Block time is specified in dOrg's \[config\]\(todo\).

The DAO has a 5 day window at the end of each block to:

**A. Initialize the next block**

1. Set values for each agent, discuss and adjust\*
2. Ratify through DAO proposal\*\*

**B. Payout the current block**

1. Readjust values for each agent
2. Ratify and distribute payments through proposal



\*Use \[Google Sheets template\]\(TODO\)

\*\*Link proposal to PR that adds CSV export to the \[docs\]\(TODO\). If the proposal fails, start over.
