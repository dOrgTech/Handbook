# Budget Blocks

dOrg agents are compensated on a block reward model. The block reward is calculated as the sum total of all revenues minus fixed expenses since the previous block. `block-freq` is defined in our [`org.json`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/org.json) \(protected\).

The DAO has a 5 day window at the end of each block to:

**A. Initialize the next block**

1. Set values for each agent, discuss and adjust
2. Ratify through DAO proposal
3. If the proposal fails, start over.

{% hint style="success" %}
DAO proposals should link to a PR that adds the block to[`/docs`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/docs)\(protected\)
{% endhint %}

**B. Payout the current block**

1. Re-adjust values for each agent
2. Distribute payments through DAO proposal
3. If the proposal fails, start over.
