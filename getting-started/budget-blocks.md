# Budget Blocks

dOrg contributors are compensated on a block reward model. The block reward is calculated as the sum total of all revenues minus fixed expenses since the previous block. `block-freq` is defined in our [`org.json`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/org.json) \(protected\).

The DAO has a 5 day window at the end of each block to:

**A. Initialize the next block**

1. Set values for each agent, discuss and adjust\*
2. Ratify through DAO proposal\*\*

**B. Payout the current block**

1. Re-adjust values for each agent
2. Ratify and distribute payments through proposal



_\*See current budget blocks_ [_here_](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/blocks.md) _\(protected\)._

_\*\*Link proposal to PR that adds CSV export to our_ [`/docs`](https://github.com/dOrgTech/operations/blob/master/docs) _\(protected\). If the proposal fails, start over._
