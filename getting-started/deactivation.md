# Deactivation

### Deactivation Threshold

Anyone who does not pass a proposal for 3 months is DEACTIVATED

* Removed from all internal spaces
* Keeps all accumulated Rep
* Can reactivate at any time by passing a proposal

### Rep Slashing

In exceptionally rare circumstances, the DAO may pass a proposal to remove an agent's Rep if the agent:

* Requests to be removed
* Abuses their voting power
* Abuses access to internal spaces
* Violates any agent agreements or community standards
