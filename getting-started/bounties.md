# Bounties

The easiest way for a new freelancer to start earning [Rep](../our-organization/understanding-rep.md) in dOrg is to complete an [open bounty](https://github.com/dOrgTech/Ecosystem/issues). If the DAO accepts your bounty, you will receive the reward along with the corresponding Rep!

Anyone is welcome to suggest new bounties by adding an issue to dOrg's [Ecosystem repo](https://github.com/dOrgTech/bounties/issues). Bounties will then be discussed and priced according to their priority, complexity and required time.
