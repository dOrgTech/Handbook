</table>### **Etiquette around going offline & availabilities**

* If you cannot join a meeting, decline the calendar invite
* Add "\[name\] Offline" in the dOrg Vacation calendar at least one week before you are going to be offline for an extended period

### Communication Hygiene â€“ Keybase

* Fully catch up with chats of teams your on + the internal-announcements chat at least once a week \(keeping up with any other chats is optional\)
* Unless you've posted as offline \(see above\), answer @mentions within 48hrs; DMs and emails w/in 24hrs
