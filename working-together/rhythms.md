# Rhythms

| What | When | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| dOrg Chat | Bimonthly | Share cross-project updates, issues, ideas |
| Budget Block | Monthly | Allocate payments |
| Retro | Quarterly | Evaluate the past quarter and plan for the next one |
| Get Together | Yearly | Hack and hang in-person |

### Communication Etiquette

* 'Accept' or 'Decline' event invites rather than ignoring them
* If you will be offline for an extended period, add "\[Name\] Offline" in the dOrg Vacation calendar at least one week before
* Answer mentions, DMs and emails within a reasonable timeframe \(1-3 days\)
* Stay up-to-date on your project channels & \#general:

* Keeping up with any other chats is optional
