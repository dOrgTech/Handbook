# Rhythms

| What | How Often | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Budget Block | Monthly | Allocate payments and share cross-project updates, issues, ideas |
| Retro | Quarterly | Evaluate the past quarter and plan for the next one |
| Jamathon | Yearly | Hack and hang in-person |

### **Etiquette around going offline & availabilities**

* If you cannot join a meeting, decline the calendar invite
* Add "\[name\] Offline" in the dOrg Vacation calendar at least one week before you are going to be offline for an extended period

### Communication Hygiene â€“ Keybase

* Fully catch up with chats of teams your on + the internal-announcements chat at least once a week \(keeping up with any other chats is optional\)
* Unless you've posted as offline \(see above\), answer @mentions within 48hrs; DMs and emails w/in 24hrs
