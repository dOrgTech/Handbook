# Rhythms

| What | How Often | When | Why |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Payment Checkpoints | Bimonthly | Varies by project | Get paid |
| Townhall | Monthly | 1st Monday of the month | Share cross-project updates, issues and ideas |
| Retro | Quarterly | 2nd to last Monday of the quarter | Evaluate the past quarter and plan for the next one |
| Jamathon | Yearly | TBD | Hack and hang in-person |

### **Etiquette around going offline & availabilities**

* If you cannot join a Townhall or Retro, decline the calendar invite. 
* Add "\[name\] Offline" in the dOrg Vacation calendar when you are going to be offline for an extended period

### Communication Hygiene â€“ Discord

* @Mention someone in the relevant chat when you need them; DM when it's urgent
* Answer @mentions within 48hrs; DM's w/in 24hrs \(unless you've posted as Offline in the calendar!\)
* Fully catch up with chats of teams your on at least once a week; Optional to keep up with any other chats
