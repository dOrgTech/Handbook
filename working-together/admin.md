### **Legal**

Legal agreements with the DAO are executed as follows:

1. DAO agent creates new agreement from template, fills out fields and emails to counter-party
2. Counter-party fills out fields, e-signs, and emails back to agent
3. Agent e-signs and submits to DAO for ratification
4. If proposal passes, agent sends passed proposal and signed agreement to counter-party

### Taxes & Bookkeeping

The DAO contracts third parties to handle its taxes and bookkeeping in accordance with U.S. and Vermont law. These third parties also send 1099s to all independent contractors of dOrg after the end of the tax year.

Each independent contractor of dOrg is responsible for handling their own taxes and bookkeeping according to the requirements of their domicile.
